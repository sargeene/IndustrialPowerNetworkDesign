⚡ Industrial Power System Design Using ETAP | Single Line Diagram (SLD)

A design and analysis of an industrial electrical distribution system using ETAP, modeled from high-voltage utility supply down to low-voltage plant and IT loads. The objective was to create a realistic, study-ready SLD that reflects real-world industrial power systems.

🔹 System Highlights:
·      Dual utility supply at 125 kV for redundancy
·      Step-down transformers across multiple voltage levels (13.8 kV, 4.16 kV, 480 V)
·      Medium- and low-voltage distribution buses with sectionalizing and tie breakers
·      Heavy industrial loads (crushers, compressors, pumps)
·      Critical loads supported by UPS and dedicated low-voltage feeders

🔹 ETAP Studies Performed:
·      Load flow analysis to verify voltage profile and transformer loading
·      Short-circuit analysis to determine fault levels and breaker ratings
·      Protective device coordination for selective fault isolation
·      Arc flash evaluation to improve personnel safety
·      Reliability and contingency analysis for utility and transformer outages

🔹 Engineering Value:
 This model demonstrates how ETAP can be used to design, validate, and optimize industrial power networks before implementation. It highlights the importance of redundancy, proper protection coordination, and voltage control when supplying mixed loads ranging from large motors to sensitive IT equipment.
